# Storefront for Seattle Hair Extension School 

This is the development storefront for Phanes Hair Extensions and Schools based in Seattle and LA. All code shown here is owned and deployed in a private repo but shown here in its development iteration to display my work. For this project I used Javascript and React for the frontend along with most of my styling being done with Bootstrap v5. It features dynamic routing on a single page. The backend is made with Ruby on Rails/Ruby with PostgreSQL. The site features user authentication built using bcrypt. There is a matching repo for the backend at https://github.com/nasjac26/clark-backend

## Setup

Navigate to your terminal, clone down this repository, & navigate to it. Make sure you clone the backend which is a seperate repo -> https://github.com/nasjac26/clark-backend

Once you have the backend running you can run:

```bash
npm install npm start
```

Should work! I am kind of new to sharing my work on github but you can email me at JacobONasrallah@gmail.com if you have any issues.
